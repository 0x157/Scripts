**Simple repository of scripts that are used to automate the boring things in this case automating installation of tooling used for cybersecurity.**

```
Directory Structure:

--> legacy_scripts: Scripts that I still use sometimes,
this directory contains installation script for volatility 2, reverse engineering tools, general tools, s
ome git shell scripts.

--> This main directory contains my main script that I run every fresh install of OS.
Minimal to no user interaction is required while the script is being ran, I tried making this very verbose by
including a lot of log messages on what is happening during run time ( including CLI progress bars ).
Installs most popular cybersecurity tools, my favourite GTK theme, certain MISC apps that I like to mess around with.
After the script is done running feel free to unintall it.

```
